							Research work covers the studies on regulatory aspects of enzymes of nitrogen assimilation, such as, nitrate reductase, glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate synthase, involving the nutritional and environmental factors. Work done also includes analyzing mode of action of trace element pollutants, Hg, Cd, Pb, As, Se and Al on these enzymes and elucidating possible mechanisms of effects. Studies involving the effects of metallic pollutants on chlorophyll metabolism analyzing the role of precursor metabolites, inhibitors and thiol compounds in relation to chlorophyll biosynthesis were worked out. Also regulatory aspects of an earlier enzyme of the pathway, Î´ - amino levulinic acid dehydratase, and intermediates of chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway in response to metallic toxicants were elucidated. Studies on salinity stress effects related to enzymes of nitrogen assimilation and effects of essential metal ions related to chlorophyll biosynthesis are in progress.
